*Manufacturing Analytics Project 
* 
Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing data, aimed at understanding production efficiency, identifying quality issues, and optimizing operations. It leverages multiple data analytics tools—MySQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau—to process, analyze, and visualize insights from raw manufacturing data.

The goal is to assist plant managers, quality control teams, and operations analysts in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

 Problem Statement 

In a manufacturing environment, it’s crucial to monitor key metrics such as:

Quantity manufactured

Rejected items

Wastage quantity

Processed units


However, due to the complexity of processes and volume of data, it becomes challenging to identify root causes of inefficiencies. This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw manufacturing data into actionable insights through visual dashboards and performance metrics.

 Tools & Technologies Used 

 1. MySQL 

Used for storing and managing raw manufacturing data.

Wrote SQL queries to:

Clean and filter data

Join multiple tables (e.g., employees, departments, machine logs)

Create derived metrics such as rejection percentage and efficiency rate

Aggregate data on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis



 2. Microsoft Excel 

Performed initial data cleaning and formatting

Used pivot tables to summarize data across departments, machines, and employees

Created basic charts (bar, line, pie) to identify early trends

Applied formulas to calculate KPIs like:

Rejection Rate = (Rejected Qty / Manufactured Qty) × 100

Wastage Ratio

Process Efficiency



 3. Power BI 

Built dynamic, interactive dashboards for business stakeholders

Key visualizations included:

KPIs: Total Manufactured Qty, Rejected Qty, Wastage, Processed Qty

Trend Analysis: Rejection trend by employee, machine, department

Slicers: Allow users to filter by date, department, or machine

Cards & Gauges: To showcase real-time performance metrics


Used DAX to create calculated measures and time-based comparisons (e.g., month-over-month rejection rate)


 4. Tableau 

Focused on more advanced and visually engaging analysis

Created:

Heat Maps for department-wise and machine-wise rejections

Bar Charts comparing efficiency across employees

Line Graphs showing performance trends over time

Scatter Plots to detect outliers or inconsistencies in quality


Used parameter controls to allow dynamic switching between KPIs



---

 KPIs Tracked 

Manufactured Quantity: Total units produced

Rejected Quantity: Defective units detected during quality checks

Wastage Quantity: Scrap or unusable material

Processed Quantity: Successfully processed units

Rejection Rate: Rejected units as a % of total manufactured

Efficiency Rate: Ratio of processed units to total time/resources used



---

 Key Insights & Outcomes 

Identified High-Rejection Departments: Certain departments and machines consistently had higher rejection rates.

Employee-Level Analysis: Pinpointed top-performing employees and those needing training.

Machine-Wise Performance: Found machines that required maintenance due to frequent issues.

Wastage Hotspots: Detected specific stages in the manufacturing process contributing to high wastage.

Operational Recommendations: Suggested process adjustments and preventive maintenance scheduling to reduce losses.

 Conclusion 

This project highlights how a multi-tool data analytics approach can transform raw manufacturing data into clear, visual insights. It empowers manufacturers to:

Reduce rejection and wastage

Improve production efficiency

Enhance employee productivity

Make data-backed decisions at every level
